# Flow1-Week3-projects

## Note
There is no Tuesday folder because we spent the day learning about and setting up tests for our rest endpoints.

# Monday
Created and worked on 2 projects - 'movieproject' and 'travisGettingStarted'. 
Got introduced to Travis and its ability to automatically deploy projects with 
every push to the GitHub repository tied to the project and learned more about 
Maven and its role in CI (continuous integration) among other things like DevOps.

There is a 3rd project in the Monday folder, but it is just the startcode project
that we have been given which in this case was used to test if we could deploy it
via Travis. Therefore, I haven't included it in the project status section, but I
was able to deploy it via Travis.

#### PROJECT STATUS
- 'movieproject' = completed
- 'travisGettingStarted' = completed

# Tuesday
Continued working on the movie project from Monday, added tests for the REST 
endpoints that I had created the day before. No new projects.

# Wednesday
Created and worked on 3 projects - 'javascript_array', 'javascript_functions', and 'js_demo'. 
Got introduced to JavaScript and did various exercises to familiarize myself with JS and
learn how to use it. The exercises involved trying out the various array functions, using
callbacks, understanding how objects are created in JS, understanding what 'this' means in JS,
and more.

#### PROJECT STATUS
- 'javascript_array' = completed
- 'javascript_functions' = completed
- 'js_demo' = completed

# Thursday
Created and worked on 2 projects - 'dom_manipulation_and_events' and 'first_time_fetch'. 
Got introduced to the more practical uses of JS by learning about DOM (document object 
model) and how we can access it and grab different HTML elements that we can use to 
manipulate an HTML page, e.g. by adding new elements through JS or modifying existing
ones without directly touching the separate HTML file. Also learned about the fetch API
and how we can fetch data with REST endpoints with a single button, rather than typing
out a specific path like we did previously.

#### PROJECT STATUS
- 'dom_manipulation_and_events' = completed
- 'first_time_fetch' = completed

# Friday
I did work on a project on Friday, but after more carefully reading our hand-in instructions,
I basically copied all files from it and put them in the movie project from Monday as instructed.
The goal for Friday was to use our new knowledge of JS to add a fetch API to our movie project,
which I managed to do. The link to the end product can be found here:
